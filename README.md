# SIGN-LANGUAGE-DETECTION-USING-MEDIAPIPE-AND-DEEP-LEARNING
Project focused on the detection and interpretation of American Sign Language (ASL) using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The research integrates MediaPipe, a framework developed by Google for hand tracking, with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, to create a system capable of recognizing sign language gestures.
